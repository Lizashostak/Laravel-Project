LIGHTWEIGHT, STIFF AND COMFORTABLE – THE WOMEN’S FREEDOM SL IS A FORMIDABLE ALPINE TOURING PERFORMER
Melding together Scarpa’s knowledge and technical know-how from their AT & Telemark collections, the women’s Freedom SL offers lightest-in-class descent performance, and a huge range of motion for climbing, with tech binding compatibility. Made from Pebax Renew – an eco-friendly plastic derived from castor oil – with over-injected carbon fibre inserts, these boots are super lightweight, while retaining their rigidity and stiffness.

A huge range of ankle mobility for those long climbs

Combing powerful descending performance and touring compatibility, the Freedom SL offers an unprecedented 27° range of motion in walk mode. The boot also offers an interchangeable sole unit which can be teamed with both an alpine and TLT to give you a versatile boot which is equally at home in resort or the backcountry.

Warmth and comfort as standard

At the centre of it all is a heat-mouldable intuition liner that delivers warmth and comfort in a whole range of conditions, whether climbing or descending. The wide and comfy toe box allows for foot splay, while flat stitching prevents any rubbing or discomfort. Warm when the temperature drops and breathable when you're climbing, the Freedom SL WMN is a great all-rounder.
