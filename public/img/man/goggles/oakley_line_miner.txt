DIG DEEP TO FIND YOUR LINES – UNPARALLELED CLARITY AND TOP-QUALITY CONSTRUCTION
The Oakley Line Miner goggle was created to provide unrivalled peripheral version. With a cylindrical style design, the goggle sits closer to your face than ever before, allowing for incredible 360° peripheral vision. The Line Miner's sleek and minimal design, paired with Oakley's unparalleled attention to detail and superb construction, make this model an easy choice for any rider.

Accommodating and sleek

We find that many of our customers who ski or snowboard in prescription glasses find the Line Miner a good goggle option as they're large enough to accommodate a small/medium set of glasses. Whilst the Line Miner isn't specifically marketed as an "over-the-glasses" or "OTG" frame they do include small, cut-out notches in the frame to accommodate glasses legs.

Premium lens construction

All lenses are dual-vented with an anti-fog coating to help inhibit misting and feature Oakley's patented, optically correct, HDO technology. Available in a range of colours, each tint is designed with specific light conditions in mind. A triple layer of micro fleece & foam helps to transport unwanted moisture away from your skin, for all-day comfort no matter how hard you're working, or how hot it is.
