AWARD WINNING PERFORMANCE FOR GO-ANYWHERE-DO-ANYTHING WOMEN.
Built for control 

The 2019 Yumi features solid binding retention and exact underfoot control with playful performance in the nose and tail. The full sidewall construction ensures that the Yumi won’t lose grip through the whole of the turn, while simultaneously absorbing high-speed vibration from crud and uneven snow pack. The rockered nose and tail not only reduce the chance of dreaded edge catch in firmer conditions, they also give the Yumi’s buoyancy a helping hand on deep days. When combined, the Yumi’s tech checklist ticks every possible box you could hope for in an all-mountain freeride ski.

The Volkl Yumi has been one of our most sought after all-mountain freeride skis for the last few seasons. Loved by all who ski them, the 2019 model sees the Yumi continue to solidify their reputation as one of the most versatile skis on the market.

Unfortunately, we're unable to ship Volkl products outside Europe, Switzerland & Norway.
