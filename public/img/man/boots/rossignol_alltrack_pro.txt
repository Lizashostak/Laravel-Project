A BOOT THAT’S AS HAPPY ON THE PISTE AS IT IS ON THE SKIN TRACK
The 2019 Rossignol Alltrack Pro 120 LT Ski Boots are part of the revamped range – lighter and packed with more downhill performance than last year’s. If you fancy spending the morning touring for some stashes, but want to meet up with the kids after their lesson for some family fun on the groomers, you’d struggle to find a better all-round boot. Rossi’s new Generative Design Grid with Grilamid keeps them as light as could be for ascending, without giving up a single iota of strength.
