SMITH’S INSANE OPTICAL CLARITY WITH ALL-NEW MAGNETIC LENS TECH
The Smith I/O Mag Goggles are a fresh addition to the line-up for this season. They offer speedy lens changeovers, and with no fewer than sixteen magnets plus a secret lock to hold them together, you’ll have no worries about losing a lens when you bail. The mid-sized frame won’t dent your peripheral vision, with a ChromaPop lens that’s loaded with tech to make sure you’ve got clear vision all day.

Optical clarity, wherever you’re headed

Smith’s polarised ChromaPop lenses filter certain light waves to enhance definition, giving you greater confidence in where you’re pointing your skis or board. TLT (Tapered Lens Technology) stops the spherical lens shape from distorting your vision, backed up with Smith’s Porex filter that keeps things clear when you’re quickly changing elevation. The inner lens has 5X anti-fog coating to keep you seeing clear, with AirEvac tech in the frame that removes heat and moisture from inside the goggle.

Comfortable to wear

The Mag I/O has Smith’s 3-layer DriWix face foam that feels comfortable and cleverly wicks moisture away from your face. The ultra-wide, silicone-backed strap will stay locked to your beanie or helmet and features a QuickFit clip that lets you adjust it in seconds. Dual axis outriggers keep them centred in your helmet.
