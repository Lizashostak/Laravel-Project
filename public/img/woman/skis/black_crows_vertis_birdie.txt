YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY – GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN – AND THE VERTIS BIRDIE IS READY TO DELIVER
The Vertis Birdie is the centrepiece of Black Crows' female-specific Resort collection. A piste-focused and super-accessible ski, with a relatively narrow 85mm waist and tight 14 or 15m turning radius, the Vertis Birdie is ideal for intermediate female riders who spend most of their time playing on the piste and want to progress their skills. It’s also just an unbelievable fun ski, so if you’re a more advanced skier who’s looking for a carver to complete your quiver, the Vertis Birdie is guaranteed to put a smile on your face.

For girls who dig groomers

The ski’s long, classic camber profile underfoot and lively poplar wood core combine to deliver a sporty and playful ride that’s easy to ski but very effective at holding an edge, so you can really dig into those carves with confidence. With that tight sidecut radius and narrower waist width it’s very quick edge-to-edge, making short turns and agile manoeuvres easy, while a light nose rocker helps to provide stability and forgiveness.

A solid construction that's built to last

Like the rest of the Black Crows range, the Vertis Birdie uses a durable semi-cap sidewall construction that protects you against knock, dings and delamination, while the chunky edges are nice and long-lasting too. If you’re looking for a stylish piste performer that’s built specifically for girls, then the Vertis is a solid choice.
